. (1) vital_status fact within buildObservations()
    Is this only acceptable for BRICCS related and a nominal ontology?
    I think this code is redundant, as is code associated with point (5)
    There HAS to be a vital_status of some description.
    I suspect in the long term it may be better to enable searching on columns within 
    the patient dimension.
    
. (2) These types are accepted as generated enumerations. Should they be decided upon by a user defined procedure?
    Note also that vital status is here. How does this relate to point (1) above?
	case Type.INT_AGE:
	case Type.INT_BEERNUMBER:
	case Type.INT_BICEPS:
	case Type.INT_CIGARETTENUMBER:
	case Type.INT_CIGARNUMBER:
	case Type.INT_DIASTOLICBP:
	case Type.INT_ETHNICITY:
	case Type.INT_HEARTRATE:
	case Type.INT_HEIGHT:
	case Type.INT_HIPS:
	case Type.INT_PIPENUMBER:							
	case Type.INT_RELATIVESNUMBER:
	case Type.INT_SMALLNUMBER:
	case Type.INT_SUBSCAPULAR:
	case Type.INT_SUPRAILIAC:
	case Type.INT_SYSTOLICBP:
	case Type.INT_TRICEPS:
	case Type.INT_WAIST:
	case Type.INT_WEIGHT:
	case Type.INT_WINESPIRITNUMBER:
	case Type.INT_YEAR:	
		//
		// Vital status added as a result of issue trac 94
	case Type.INT_VITALSTATUS:
	
	I think the above should be kept as they are in the code, and eventually remove them from the ontology.
	
. (3) Still some briccs specific stuff:
	Admin.Participant.age
	Admin.Participant.pat_ethnicity
	===>>>Admin.Participant.vital_status<<<=== this is an error, there is no such variable in Onyx
	Admin.Participant.gender
	Admin.Participant.recruitmentType
	
	The above are NOT Briccs specific. They are Onyx built in variables!
	However, I am uncertain whether other questionnaires might extend a Participants' attributes.
	This is possible. Needs careful thought!!!
	
. (4) buildFact_Numeric() and buildFact_Text() are both bypassed if the ontology is nominal.
	Is this correct?
	Yes! Unless we come up with a way of searching numeric; ie: the next turn of the screw is
	how to provide metadata.xml

. (5) buildVitalStatusFact() requires thinking about. (see points 1 and 2 above).
	Uses Admin.Participant.captureStartDate and Admin.Participant.captureEndDate,
	which makes the code Briccs specific? Maybe not. But needs thinking about.
	
. (6) getEnrollmentId() uses Admin.Participant.enrollmentId
	getGender()	uses Admin.Participant.gender
	getEthnicity() uses Admin.Participant.pat_ethnicity	
	getRecruitmentCode() uses Admin.Participant.recruitmentType
	
	See point (3) above. 
	*** It is acceptable except for enrollmentId. ***
	
(7) protected String participantId
	Check the above attribute
	It is also used in OnyxData2PdoWs.java
	
. (8) Also consider visit dimension start date
	Looks OK at least for the moment, driven by the config file.
	Maybe the code is a little busy.
